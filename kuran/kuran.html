    <h1>The Qur'an</h1>
    <p>
      In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
      All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
      The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
      Master of the Day of Judgment.
      You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help.
      Guide us to the straight path.
      The path of those whom You have favored, not of those who have earned Your anger, nor of those who have gone astray.
    </p>
    <p>
